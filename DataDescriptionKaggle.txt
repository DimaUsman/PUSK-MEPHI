Data Description
Your task is to schedule the families to Santa's Workshop in a way that minimizes the penalty cost to Santa (as described on the Evaluation page).

Each family has listed their top 10 preferences for the dates they'd like to attend Santa's workshop tour. Dates are integer values representing the days before Christmas, e.g., the value 1 represents Dec 24, the value 2 represents Dec 23, etc. Each family also has a number of people attending, n_people.

Every family must be scheduled for one and only one assigned_day.
